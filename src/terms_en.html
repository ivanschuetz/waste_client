    <p class="terms-bullet"><a id="section-general">GENERAL INFORMATION</a></p>
    <p class="terms-subbullet">These WOHIN-MIT Terms and Conditions (the <span class="terms-highlighted">"Terms"</span>) constitute a legally
        binding agreement between an individual user
        (the <span class="terms-highlighted">"user"</span>) accessing and using the website https://wohin-mit.de and the related services
        (collectively, <span class="terms-highlighted">"WOHIN-MIT"</span>) and the operator
        of WOHIN-MIT Ivan Schütz having a business address at Birkenstraße 15, 10559 Berlin, Germany (<span class="terms-highlighted">"we"</span>,
        <span class="terms-highlighted">"us"</span>, and <span class="terms-highlighted">"our"</span>).
        We recommend the user to save a copy of these Terms for future reference.</p>
    <p class="terms-subbullet"><span class="terms-highlighted">About WOHIN-MIT.</span> WOHIN-MIT is an online platform featuring information about
        available waste disposal, recycling,
        donation, second-hand service locations, online shops, web-based marketplaces, charity shops, and second-hand retailers operated by
        third parties (the <span class="terms-highlighted">"Providers"</span>).</p>
    <p class="terms-subbullet"><span class="terms-highlighted">License to use WOHIN-MIT.</span> We grant the user a personal, revocable,
        non-exclusive, non-commercial,
        non-transferable and limited license to use WOHIN-MIT pursuant to these Terms. WOHIN-MIT is primarily aimed at users residing in Germany.
        The user is not allowed to use WOHIN-MIT in countries where it may be restricted or prohibited by local legislation.</p>
    <p class="terms-subbullet"><span class="terms-highlighted">Minors.</span> WOHIN-MIT is not marketed and should not be used by persons under
        the age of 18 without adult supervision.
        Due to its nature, WOHIN-MIT may be used for informational or educational purposes (e.g., to educate students about the benefits of recycling)
        because it does not contain any inappropriate or harmful online content. Thus, if a person under the age of 18 would like to access or use
        WOHIN-MIT, an adult should monitor child’s use of WOHIN-MIT.
    </p>
    <p class="terms-subbullet"><span class="terms-highlighted">Third-party links</span>. WOHIN-MIT may contain links to websites, applications,
        services, and other online sources owned

    <p class="terms-bullet"><a id="section-contracts-providers-users">Contracts concluded between PROVIDERS AND USERS</a></p>
    <p class="terms-subbullet">WOHIN-MIT serves as a reference point and a platform that may facilitate formation of service contracts
        (the <span class="terms-highlighted">"Contracts"</span>) between the users and the Providers. WOHIN-MIT does not intervene in any manner
        into the communication between the
        Providers and the users, as well as negotiation, conclusion, and execution of the Contracts.
    </p>
    <p class="terms-subbullet">If the Providers and the users (collectively, the <span class="terms-highlighted">"Contractors"</span>) decide to
        enter into the Contract as a result of
        the information available on WOHIN-MIT, the Contract is a contractual relationship between the Contractors and the Contractors have
        complete discretion with regard whether to enter into the Contract and the terms of the Contract. The Contractors acknowledge and
        agree that we are not a party to the Contract and the formation of the Contract does not create employment, partnership, joint venture,
        or other service relationships between the Contractors and us. The Contractors may enter into any agreements as they deem to be
        appropriate (e.g., a confidentiality or assignment agreements), provided that such agreements do not conflict with, narrow, or expand
        these Terms.</p>
    <p class="terms-subbullet">By concluding the Contracts, the users agree that (i) they are receiving services from the respective Providers
        and not directly from us and (ii) the Providers are solely responsible for delivering those services. Therefore, for any specifics
        related to the Contracts, the users are requested to contact the respective Provider.</p>
    <p class="terms-subbullet">We are not a party to the Contracts and, therefore, we will not be liable for any direct, indirect, consequential
        or inconsequential loss or damage that results from the Contracts and any transactions made between the Contractors.</p>
    <p class="terms-subbullet">The Providers and not us are solely responsible for:</p>
    <ul class="terms-embedded-list">
        <li>Ensuring that the Providers are qualified in providing their services featured through WOHIN-MIT;</li>
        <li>Preparing, negotiating, concluding, and executing the Contracts;</li>
        <li>Issuing invoices; and</li>
        <li>Paying all taxes, duties, insurance payments, social security and unemployment contributions, and other fees associated with payments
            made under the Contracts.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="terms-subbullet">WOHIN-MIT provides general information about the Providers. Please note that WOHIN-MIT features only a limited list of
        the Providers available in user’s area that is compiled by us and may be updated from time to time. The list of the Providers available
        on WOHIN-MIT does not constitute an exhaustive list of the Providers available.</p>
    <p class="terms-subbullet">Although we put reasonable efforts to ensure that all information on WOHIN-MIT is true, accurate, correct, and
        up-to-date, we do not guarantee that any information, accreditation, and contact data of the Providers is true, accurate, correct,
        and up-to-date, as such information may change without a prior notice to us.</p>
    <p class="terms-subbullet">We make no warranties regarding any services provided by the Providers and any transactions carried as a result of
        the use of WOHIN-MIT. The users are solely responsible for carrying out appropriate checks regarding the Providers,
        including their relevant trade and industry accreditations, qualifications, and legal authorizations, prior to concluding the Contracts.
        We strongly encourage the users not to engage in any business relationships (i) without conducting such checks or (ii) if the users have
        any doubts or concerns regarding the Providers.</p>
    <p class="terms-subbullet">We are not responsible for any disputes that arise between the Contractors. We are not obliged to receive or
        process complaints against the users of WOHIN-MIT or resolve disputes between the users of WOHIN-MIT or the Contractors,
        unless the complaint concerns the performance of our legal or contractual obligations under these Terms.</p>

    <p class="terms-bullet"><a id="section-disclaimer-of-warranties">DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES</a></p>

    <p class="terms-subbullet">By using WOHIN-MIT, the user acknowledges that we may use third-party suppliers to provide software, hardware,

        control. To the maximum extent permitted by law, we exclude any liability for any loss or damage resulting from the acts and omissions of
        such third-party suppliers.</p>
    <p class="terms-subbullet">Nothing in these Terms shall affect any statutory rights that the user is entitled to as a consumer and that the

    <p class="terms-bullet"><a id="section-limitation-of-liability">LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</a></p>

        our reasonable control.</p>
    <p class="terms-subbullet">We will not be liable to the user for any direct, indirect or consequential losses, which may be incurred by the

        with the laws of the Federal Republic of
        Germany without regard to its conflicts of law provisions.</p>
    <p class="terms-subbullet"><span class="terms-highlighted">Jurisdiction.</span> The user agrees to resolve any disputes arising out of or
        relating to these Terms by means of negotiation
        with us. If the dispute cannot be resolved by means of negotiation, the dispute shall be submitted to an alternative dispute resolution (ADR)
        body.</p>
    <p class="terms-subbullet"><span class="terms-highlighted">Alternative dispute resolution (ADR).</span> ADR body acts as an independent
        middleman between an Internet service provider
        and a customer when an initial complaint cannot be resolved. No legal assistance or representation is necessary for taking a case to an ADR
        scheme. The ADR body investigates complains by looking at consumer’s and Internet service provider’s arguments and comes to a decision it
        deems to be fair.</p>
    <p class="terms-subbullet">To facilitate the resolution of disputes regarding online services, the European Commission developed a web-based
        online dispute resolution platform that allows disputes to be resolved out-of-court at a low cost in a simple and fast way. The platform is
        available in 23 official languages of the European Union at https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/odr .</p>

        WOHIN-MIT,
        and our business practices. We will indicate the date of the last amendment at the top of the Terms. User’s continued use of WOHIN-MIT after
